# Data-Analytics-Learning-RoadMap

After 2.5 years as a Content Data Analyst, Iâ€™ve decided to take the leap into a more technical and impactful Data Analyst role â€” and Iâ€™ve built a structured 30-day learning roadmap to get there. If you're planning a similar transition, I hope this helps guide your path too!

ðŸ”§ Tools Iâ€™m Focusing On:
SQL â€“ For advanced data querying and insights

Excel â€“ Still a powerhouse for quick analysis and reporting

Power BI â€“ For building dynamic dashboards and reports

Python (pandas, seaborn) â€“ To clean, analyze, and visualize data efficiently

ðŸš€ Trending Tools Iâ€™m Exploring:
Tool	Why Itâ€™s Hot
dbt	Modern data transformation (analytics engineering)
BigQuery / Snowflake	Scalable cloud data warehouses
Tableau	Data storytelling at scale
Airbyte / Fivetran	Automated data pipelines
Looker	Embedded analytics and metrics layers

ðŸ“… My After-Office Hours Plan (2â€“3 hrs/day):
Week 1: SQL & Excel deep dive

Week 2: Power BI & storytelling dashboards

Week 3: Python for analysis + intro to dbt & Tableau

Week 4: Cloud tools (BigQuery, Snowflake) + final projects + resume/portfolio polish

âœ… Key Outcomes:
Build 2 end-to-end projects (SQL + Power BI + Python)

Polish my resume and GitHub/Notion portfolio

Start applying for Data Analyst roles with confidence
